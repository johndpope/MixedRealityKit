#  MixedRealityKit

An easy way to add a stereoscopic ARKit SceneView to your project.

The MixedRealityKit class extends ARSCNView and splits camera in two stereoscopic SceneViews. Works with Google Cardboard or any VR Viewer that supports non-barrel distorted VR.

## Setting up a new Project to use MixedRealityKit

1. Add to your podfile:

`pod 'MixedRealityKit'`

2. In Terminal, navigate to your project folder, then:

`pod update`

`pod install`


3. Make sure the **Camera Usage Description** key is set in your info.plist.
4. For best results, uncheck **Portrait** under Device Orientation. Due to some weirdness with the scene flipping upside down, you need both **Landscape Left** and **Landscape Right** checked.

Change your ViewController class to look like the following

```swift
import UIKit
import SceneKit
import MixedRealityKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, MixedRealityDelegate {

    var sceneView:MixedRealityKit?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.

        sceneView=MixedRealityKit(frame: view.frame)
        sceneView?.mixedRealityDelegate = self

        let scene=SCNScene(named: "art.scnassets/Room.scn")!
        sceneView?.scene=scene

        view.addSubview(sceneView!)
    }

    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)
        sceneView?.runSession(detectPlanes: true)
    }

    override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillDisappear(animated)
        sceneView?.pauseSession()
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }

    // MixedReality Delegates
    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, updateAtTime time: TimeInterval) {

    }

    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didAdd node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor) {

    }

    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, willUpdate node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor) {

    }

    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didRemove node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor) {

    }

}


```

You can use the Room.scn file provided in this repo, or create an empty SCNScene(), adding your own nodes to it. If you are adding a floor to your scene, you will need to play with the y-axis positioning so it matches the relative eye level. I found that -1.7 worked well.

## Delegates

I added a new delegate to the MixedRealityKit class called **mixedRealityDelegate** which allows you to optionally override the ARSCNViewDelegate methods in your ViewController as you normally would, passing them to the MixedRealityKit class.


## Options

**disableSleepMode** - (default: _true_): When set to _true_ your device will not go turn off when idle. This can be overridden, but since your device will likely be in a Google Cardboard, you will not want it to go to sleep.

The **runSession()** method takes the optional parameter **detectPlanes** (default: _false_). As of now, only horizontal plane detection is available out of the box.
